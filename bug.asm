```assembly
mov ax, 1000h ; move 1000h into ax register
add ax, bx ; add bx to ax
; ... more instructions
```
The error occurs when the value in `bx` is large enough that adding it to `ax` causes an overflow.  The overflow is not handled gracefully, leading to unexpected results or a program crash. This is more likely to be a problem on 16-bit systems where registers have a limited size.
